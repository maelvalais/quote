## Install

### Dev

```sh
brew install protobuf # only if .proto files are changed
go generate ./...     # only if .proto files are changed
go build
./quote
```

### Docker

```sh
docker build . -f ci/Dockerfile
```

For building the CLI, I used the cobra cli generator:

```sh
go get github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra
```

## Side notes

### Vendor or not vendor and go 1.11 modules

I use `GO111MODULES=on`. This is definitely debatable: in actual projects that I
may have to maintain on the long run, a more 'stable' option such as 'dep'
should be used (as of June 2019 at least). The reason is that I feel many
tools and libraries do not (yet) work with vgo (go 1.11 modules).

In the first iterations of this project, I was vendoring (using `go mod vendor`)
and checked the vendor/ folder in with the code. Then, I realized things have
evolved and it is not necessary anymore (as of june 2019; see [should-i-vendor]
as things may evolve).

That said, I often use `go mod vendor` which comes very handy (I can browse the
dependencies sources easily, everything is at hand).

[should-i-vendor]: https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/9ai79z/correct_usage_of_go_modules_vendor_still_connects/

### `quote version`

I decided to use <https://github.com/ahmetb/govvv> in order to ease the
process of using `-ldflags -Xmain.Version=$(git describe)` and so on. I
could have done it without it üôÑ

### Proto generation

Ideally, the `.proto` and the generated `.pb.go` should be separated from
my service, e.g. `github.com/maelvalais/schema` with semver versionning and
auto-generated `.pb.go` by the CI (see this [SO
discussion](proto-monorepo)). Or maybe the `.pb.go` should be owned by
their respective services... Depending on the use of GO111MODULES or `dep`.

For `*.pb.go` generation, I use the annotation `//go:generate protoc`. In order
to re-generate the pb files from the proto files, don't forget to do:

```sh
go generate ./...
```

### Logs, debug and verbosity

I did not yet implement a way for my server or my client to make the log level
higher or to set json as the logging format. For now, I use logrus; fortunately,
logrus allows to configure these things.

<!--
I did not implement a way of logrotating the logs ([traefik's log rotation][traefik-logrotate]
is an excellent source of inspiration in that regard)

### Static analysis, DevSecOps and CI

- CI and commit hook : <https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint> which
  runs gosec, go-critic and so on.
- CI and commit hook: conventional-commit using github.com/geocine/golem
  (see [golem-post]). I also like using emojis
  (github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) but the use of emojis is much more
  debatable üòÅ
- `GO111MODULES=off go get github.com/maruel/pre-commit-go/cmd/...` and
  `pcg install` (caveat: it forces the dev to have no untracked file before
  committing... good thing from my experience: it forces you to check in
  the untracked files as soon as possible, see [pcg-untracked-issue]). Pcg
  will run go build on every commit so that you don't have a failing commit
  (easier to `git bisect` üëç)

## Examples that I read for inspiration

- [go-micro-services] (lacks tests but excellent geographic-related
  business case)
- [route_guide] (example from the official grpc-go)
- [go-scaffold] (mainly for the BDD unit + using Ginkgo)
- [todogo] (just for the general layout)

## Tools I used

- editors: vim, vscode and goland
- misc: prototool (for testing the gRPC server)

## Cloud native

Cloud-native is taking advantage when your workload is on the cloud ([cncf-definition], [gitlab-native-talk]):

- use containers,
- dynamically orchestrated
- use micro-services

## 12factor

[12factor] is a manifest originally proposed by Heroku and largely adopted among
the community. It presents the 12 main ideas that should be thought of when
building an application that is meant to be run on a cloud provider (e.g.,
platforms like Now.sh or Heroku or any other cloud-oriented platform such as
Kubernetes). Here is a checklist for my microservice and its CLI (source:
